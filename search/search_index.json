I tried to take the end of the third book as a jumping off point for learning more about Rust and various quality of life improvements and performance enhancements. I added a UI with egui and increased performance with ultraviolet and rayon. I removed all of the smart pointers, dynamic dispatches and recursive rendering, replacing them with dependency injection of services and using indices, enums for handling structs implementing an interface and recursion was replaced by a loop based on pbrt's render loop. Additionally, I added subpixel sampling, as a form of stratification, based on smallpt. Ultimately, as I wanted to implement more advanced topics, the overly paedagogical architecture from Peter Shirleys books proved to be hard to continue to adapt without massive changes.</p>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"CV","text":"<p>You can check out my CV on  \ud83d\udcf0 LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"teaching/","title":"Teaching","text":"<p>I wrote an online guide developed for teaching machine learners about performance.
