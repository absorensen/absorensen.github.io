## raytracing_in_rust

Link: <https://github.com/SkafteNicki/libcpab>

*libcpab* provide an library for working with diffiomorphic transformations in both numpy, tensorflow and pytorch. The
library is written to be user friendly, such that you do not have to know the slightest thing about diffiomorphic
transformations to actually get started with using them. The code is designed to work with both 1D data (time series),
2D data (images) and 3D data (volumetric images).
